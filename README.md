# Menu Creator
A tool to create custom UI from the list of properties of an object.

## Features
- quick creation of a custom UI from the properties of an Object (Mesh and Light types at the moment)
- simple sorting of properties
- active object or global UI settings

## Current limitations
- at the moment the addon can create UI only on the .blend file. In the future it will generate a .py file to export
- only one global UI is supported, while a dedicated UI for each object is possible
