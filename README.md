# Menu Creator
A tool to create custom UI from the list of properties of an object.

## Features
- quick creation of a custom UI from the properties of an Object
- simple sorting of properties
- active object or global UI settings

## Current limitations
- at the moment the addon can create UI on the .blend file, and it also imports menus when objects are appended in new .blend files. In the future it will also generate a .py file to export
- only one global UI is supported, while a dedicated UI for each object is possible

## Current object supported
- general object options (name, location, etc..)
- mesh properties
- shape keys properties (general and single properties)
- material properties (no nodes at the moment)
- lights
